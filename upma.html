    <h1>UPMA</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In Andhra they call this upma 'Bombay rava' upma. It is extremely soft and spongy in texture. When I was a kid, I loved eating this upma as balls rolled in sugar. This upma makes an excellent accompaniment to pesarattu.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon split Bengal gram (chana dal)</li>
        <li>1 dried red chile pepper, crushed</li>
        <li>1 cup semolina (sooji rava)</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup cooking oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>1 tomato, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the dried red chile peppers, cashews, urad dal, chana dal, and mustard seed in the hot oil until the cashews are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the asafoetida powder into the skillet. Add the onion, green chile peppers, and curry leaves to the mixture; cook and stir until the onions are softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the water into the skillet along with the tomato, ginger, and salt; bring to a boil. Gradually pour the semolina into the mixture in a thin stream, stirring continually. This is very important. If you add the semolina too quickly, or do not stir quick enough, you will get lumps. Cook and stir until the mixture begins bubbling; reduce heat to low, cover, and allow to cook 10 to 15 minutes. Stir the lime juice and ghee into the mixture. Remove from heat and allow to rest 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
